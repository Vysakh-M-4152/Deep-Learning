Pneumonia Detection Using Vision Transformer (ViT)
This project leverages the power of Vision Transformer (ViT), a cutting-edge deep learning model, to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great performance in medical image analysis, but transformers bring a new level of accuracy and interpretability by modeling long-range dependencies in image patches.

 Features
Utilizes Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification.

Trained on chest X-ray datasets (e.g., Kaggleâ€™s Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset).

Detects pneumonia with high accuracy, suitable for assisting clinical diagnosis.

Includes training scripts, evaluation metrics, and model visualization.

Easily extendable and customizable.
